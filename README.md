## Sundial ðŸš§

Sundial is a library written in pure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) which partially implements the [iCalendar spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) to support parsing of RRules.

### Current high level features to be supported in this project

- Ability to parse an RRule to a json representation

- Ability to extract an RRule implementation from a given json

- Ability to generate next iteration/iterations given an RRule string

### RFC5545 spec features supported

Since the library is designed purely to support the [RRules section of the spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10) at the moment, features will be added iteratively for each type of RRule support:

* Checked boxes mean the feature is supported
* Unchecked means feature is not supported but will be in future releases
* N/A means the feature is not applicable for the RRule type per the spec
* N/S means the feature will not be support at present by this library
